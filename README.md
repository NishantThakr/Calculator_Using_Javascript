This JavaScript code is a basic implementation of a simple calculator interface that takes user input from buttons and displays the result in an input box. Below is a non-technical documentation explaining how the code works:

## Calculator Implementation Documentation

### Overview:

This JavaScript code is designed to create a basic calculator interface on a web page. It utilizes HTML for the structure and JavaScript for the functionality. The calculator allows users to input mathematical expressions using buttons and displays the result in a designated input box.

### HTML Structure:

The calculator interface is assumed to have an input box with the id "inputBox" and several buttons that users can click. Each button has an associated function: numeric digits, arithmetic operators, "=", "AC" (for clearing the input), and "DEL" (for deleting the last input).

### JavaScript Implementation:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```javascript
   let input = document.getElementById("inputBox");
   let buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
   let string = "";
   let arr = Array.from(buttons);
   ```

   - **Explanation:** 
     - The `input` variable holds a reference to the HTML element with the id "inputBox," which is the input field where the calculator displays results.
     - The `buttons` variable stores a NodeList of all the button elements on the page.
     - The `string` variable will hold the current input expression.
     - The `arr` variable is an array created from the NodeList of buttons.

2. **Event Listeners:**
   ```javascript
   arr.forEach((button) => {
     button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - A loop is set up to iterate through each button in the array.
     - An event listener is attached to each button to respond to a click event.

3. **Button Click Handling:**
   ```javascript
       if (e.target.innerHTML == "=") {
         string = eval(string);
         input.value = string;
       } else if (e.target.innerHTML == "AC") {
         string = "";
         input.value = string;
       } else if (e.target.innerHTML == "DEL") {
         string = string.substring(0, string.length - 1);
         input.value = string;
       } else {
         string += e.target.innerHTML;
         input.value = string;
       }
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - If the clicked button has the inner HTML content "=" (equals), the calculator evaluates the current expression using the `eval` function and updates the input field with the result.
     - If the clicked button has the inner HTML content "AC" (all clear), the calculator resets the current expression to an empty string, clearing the input field.
     - If the clicked button has the inner HTML content "DEL" (delete), the calculator removes the last character from the current expression and updates the input field.
     - For all other buttons (numeric digits and operators), the corresponding content is appended to the current expression, and the input field is updated accordingly.

### Usage:

To use the calculator, simply click on the numeric digits, operators, and other buttons to input your expression. Click "=" to get the result, "AC" to clear the input, and "DEL" to delete the last input.
